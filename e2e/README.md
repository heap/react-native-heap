# React Native Tests
This folder contains automated tests against the TestDriver app in the `examples/` folder. The test assertions depend on internal Heap utilities, so the tests can only be run by Heap engineers with access to the internal repo. Further instructions can be found in the internal repo [here](https://github.com/heap/heap/blob/develop/test/tracker/react-native/README.md).

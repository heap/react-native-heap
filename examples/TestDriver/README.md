# React Native Tests
This folder contains a React Native test app that demonstrates the library's API, and can be used to test changes to the library. By default, all heap requests are sent to `localhost:3000`.

<!-- :TODO: (jmtaber129): Add instructions for how to run the app. -->

<!-- :TODO: (jmtaber129): Add instructions for how to modify the app to send requests to prod Heap. -->
